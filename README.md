# Hi, I'm Tom
A Software Engineer & Architect.

I'm an Australian who enjoys strumming the guitar, 
Muay Thai, and has a weakness for bacon & egg rolls on 
a Saturday morning.

I also love building things and to scratch that itch,
I tinker with [.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/), [Microsoft Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) 
and [React](https://reactjs.org) with a focus on System Design. If you're interested in this too, take a look at my website, [Pedlar](https://pedlar.io).
